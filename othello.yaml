  Our project is a single-computer terminal version of the game Othello.
  Players can input moves into the terminal and try to strategically 
  place their pieces so that they finish the game with the most pieces on the 
  board.

  The game supports multiplayer and singleplayer functionality. A singleplayer 
  game can be played against an easy, medium, hard, or extreme AI opponent. 
  The game also supports an in-game 'history' mode which allows you to 
  revert to a specific point in your game history.
