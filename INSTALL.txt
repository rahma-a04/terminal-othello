Instructions to build system and play game: 

1. Download the zip file. Create a working directory for this project. 

Linux/Mac: Move the zip file into your work directory. Once you have the zip 
file in your directory, just run <unzip othello.zip>

Windows: 
    - move your zip file in the downloads folder in your c drive, with the name
      <othello.zip> 
    - open ubuntu
    - next, use cd to naviagate to the working directory you created for this 
      project 
    - next, run 
    <cp /mnt/c/Users/"your Windows user name"/Downloads/othello.zip .>
    - from your work directory, run <unzip othello.zip>

2. Run <cd othello>

3. In the terminal run dune build in the project directory

4. Type command "make othello" to start the othello game

5. Next, type 's difficulty', with difficulty being easy, medium, hard, or godmode, 
for singleplayer. For multiplayer, type 'm'. You can also type 'q' to quit, and 
'h' for help.

     Example 's medium'

6. If playing against a computer, choose a color. You may respond 'b' for black 
and 'w' for white. Otherwise, the game automatically starts with black, and one
player can choose to start the game.

7. Congrats! You started the game! You can enter moves as (letter, number). 
Example 'f 5'. The board is printed as a grid. The empty spaces are empty. The 
black tiles are the circles with black in the center. The white tiles are circles
with white in the center. The range of values for row is 1 <= row <= 8 and column 
is A <= column <= H. 

8. If you are playing in mutiplayer mode, you can enter moves for each color one 
after the other. 
If you are playing in singleplayer, after you enter the first move, the computer 
will play its own move and you can enter your next move. 

9. Type 'q' at any point to quit the game. Type 'h' at any point for the valid 
commands. Type 'history' at any point in the game to enter history mode.

10. When finished, run dune clean in terminal.
